# git config

When first setting up git, you'll need to work with git config commands in order to set up your identity.

For example, your identity can be set up with commans such as:

```
git config --global user.name "Arnold Shorman"
git config --global user.email arnoldshortman2020gmail.com
```

For more information, view the [first time git setup](https//git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) documentation.
